								<h5>How to Measure</h5>
								<h6>1. Chest</h6>
								<p>Use a measuring tape to circle your chest, placing the measuring tape under the armpits and across the fullest part of the chest. For the most accurate measurement, the tape must be level.</p>
								<h6>2. Arm Length</h6>
								<p>Use a measuring tape, place the end of the tape to the tip of your shoulder and stretch the tape down to the part of the wrist the cuff would normally sit.</p>
